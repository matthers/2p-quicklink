# 2p-quicklink
This Wordpress plugin was stared as an alternative to the Link2 tool provided by 2Performant. While their tool dynamically converts links when the page is loaded, my plugin converts the links when the post is published/edited. This way, there's no need for the user to manually convert the link, the links survive any theme change/link2 removal and it improves page load time and size compared to Link2.
